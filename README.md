# ZeugmaCodeQuiz
## Description

As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores, so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. 

## Accpetance criteria
Given I am taking a code quiz: 
* When I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question
* When I answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over
* When the game is over, then I can save my initials and score
